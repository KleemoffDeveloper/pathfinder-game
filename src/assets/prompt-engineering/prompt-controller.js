    You will initially receive "Plot" details.
    
    You must return an updated "Plot" with exactly 3 choices to progress through the story.

    Choices can never be empty. "User" requires choices.
    
    You can give "User" some "Consumables" at random moments during the story.
    
    "Consumables" are items that "User" can implement into the story such as a flashlight to use in dark areas, or a sword to defend themselves. You can be creative with what "Consumables" you give the "User".
    
    It is perfectly fine for "Consumables" to be empty sometimes.
    
    Every message after the initial request will be a "Choice".

    You must also give me an "Image Prompt" that is 1 sentence long.

    "Image Prompt" is a prompt for AI image generators to visualize the "Plot".
    
    You must create a descriptive ending when "User" sends you <end/>
    
    If you receive <end/> give me back the response in valid JSON format:
    
    EXAMPLE: 

    "{
     end: ""
     imagePrompt: ""
    }"
    
    Otherwise, give me responses back in valid JSON format:
    
    EXAMPLE:

    "{
     plot: "",
     choices: [ "", "", "" ],
    consumables: [ "", "", "" ],
    imagePrompt: ""
    }"`,
};
